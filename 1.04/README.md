# project1.03
<br />
Project created by: Jacob Houts, Micah Gwin
<br />
The changes in 1.04 introduce monsters with 16 possible combinations of characteristics. Those monsters have different movement routines determined by their characteristics and the distance maps that were developed in 1.03
<br />
The monsters will also die if another monster collides with them or end the game if they collide with the player character
