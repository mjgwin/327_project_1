# project1.05
<br />
Project created by: Jacob Houts, Micah Gwin
<br />
The changes in 1.05 introduce movement using the curses framework in addition to other key press actions such as a quit key and status menu
<br />
Now the game screen is refreshed in place which looks much smoother than being printed to the terminal repeatedly
<br />
In addition, stairs now provide a way to travel between new generated dungeons in the same game
