# project1.06
<br />
Project created by: Jacob Houts, Micah Gwin
<br />
The changes in 1.06 introduce a transition from c to c++ and switching to a different coding language.
<br />
In addition, there is a fog of war feature which obstructs the map.
<br />
And finally there is a teleport feature which allows the player to move around the map like a cheat code.
