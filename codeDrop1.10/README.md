# project1.10
<br />
Project created by: Jacob Houts, Micah Gwin
<br />
The changes in 1.10 add ranged weapons such as a bow or cannon into the item list the player can use
<br />
When a ranged weapon is equipped, the player can attack monsters with a similar UI to teleporting, and if a monser is selected it will take damage
