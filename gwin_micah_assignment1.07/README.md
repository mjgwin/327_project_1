# project1.07
<br />
Project created by: Jacob Houts, Micah Gwin
<br />
The changes in 1.07 are all about parsing the contents of a file that contains monster attributes.
<br />
This is useful because now it is possible to have many types of monsters without having to hard code them.
<br />
In addition, the loaded monsters are stored in a data structure which can be used throughout the program.
